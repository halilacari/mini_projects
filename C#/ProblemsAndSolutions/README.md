#Problem3:

Example: 

Input = deF43ab3xd5z

Output = Letters = a,b,d,e,F,x,z
Output = Numbers = 3,4,5

#Problem5:

Write an example of a method that takes 3 decimal type parameters and returns the largest decimal type number.

#Problem6:

Let there be a method called Add. Let me have the opportunity to send 2 int type numbers or 3 decimal type numbers. The method should not return a value. Let it add up the numbers I send and export the result with a parameter. (Method overloading and out should be used)
